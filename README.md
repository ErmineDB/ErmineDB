# ErmineDB

ErmineDB is in development and not ready for use yet.
When ErmineDB is ready it will be a key/value database that
duplicates the Redis protocol.  That means you can use any
existing Redis client to connect to ErmineDB.
There are a number of planned advantages.  Logging of CRUD,
cluster replication using Raft just to name two.
